# QA

Code-quality policy for `homebase`. All tools are dev-dependencies in
`pyproject.toml` (`[dependency-groups] dev`). Run via `uv run`.

This document is **authoritative**. Update the status table and the
history CSV/SVG after every QA run (see [Recording history](#recording-history)).
Baseline numbers must never regress — fix the code, don't bump the
number.

## Tools

### 1. pytest — test suite

```
uv run pytest
```

- All tests must pass at every commit (AGENTS.md §9).
- Per-bug-fix: add or update regression test in the same change.
- No filesystem/sqlite mocking — use `tmp_path`.

### 2. ruff — lint + import order

```
uv run ruff check src/homebase/ tests/
```

- Must be clean at every commit (AGENTS.md §10).
- `[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]` must remain empty. Fix code, not
  config.

### 3. mypy — static typing

```
uv run mypy src/homebase
```

- Config in `pyproject.toml` `[tool.mypy]`: `check_untyped_defs`,
  `warn_unreachable`, `warn_unused_ignores`, `warn_redundant_casts`.
- No `# type: ignore` without an inline comment explaining why.

### 4. pytest-cov — branch coverage

```
uv run pytest --cov=homebase --cov-report=term
uv run pytest --cov=homebase --cov-report=html   # detailed
```

- Config in `pyproject.toml` `[tool.coverage.*]` (branch coverage on).
- Slow (~100 s). Run after meaningful changes, not on every save.

![branch coverage over time](graphs/coverage.svg)

### 5. import-linter — layering enforcement

```
uv run lint-imports
```

- Contract in `pyproject.toml` `[tool.importlinter]` mirrors AGENTS.md
  §5 layering. Each iteration must remove at least one violation.

![import-linter violations over time](graphs/import-linter.svg)

### 6. vulture — dead code

```
uv run vulture src/homebase                       # high-confidence only
uv run vulture src/homebase --min-confidence 60   # broader review
```

- Clean at default confidence (80). Lower-confidence findings are
  reviewed per iteration; suppress with `# noqa: vulture  # reason`
  only with a justification.
- Not tracked over time (binary at confidence 80; review-only at 60).

### 7. bandit — security linting

```
uv run bandit -q -r src/homebase
```

- Suppress intentional findings with `# nosec BXXX  # reason`.

![bandit findings over time](graphs/bandit.svg)

### 8. radon — complexity + maintainability

```
uv run radon cc src/homebase -a -s -n C   # cyclomatic complexity, C+
uv run radon mi src/homebase -s -n B      # maintainability index, ≤ B
```

- Refactor target per AGENTS.md §7 (~500-line module rule).
- `cc` is tracked over time; `mi` is a snapshot.

### 9. benchmark — runtime performance score

```
uv b benchmark run         # produces a new scored run
uv b benchmark results     # show full history
```

- Uses the existing `b benchmark` machinery. `qa_track.py benchmark`
  does **not** run the suite — it reads the canonical YAML at
  `<base>/.homebase/benchmark.yaml` and projects three series into the
  QA history: `score` (composite), `warm_sc`, `cold_sc`.
- `score` is a weighted composite:
  `BENCHMARK_SCORE_WARM_WEIGHT * warm + BENCHMARK_SCORE_COLD_WEIGHT * cold`
  (currently 0.7 / 0.3, see `core/constants.py`). Computed in
  `workspace/benchmark_report.composite_score`; `score_runs` recomputes
  it on read so older runs in `benchmark.yaml` display the new
  composite as long as `warm_elapsed_s` and `cold_elapsed_s` exist.
- Multiple runs on the same day are kept and labelled `YYYY-MM-DD_1`,
  `YYYY-MM-DD_2`, …; single-run days have no suffix.
- The CSV is rebuilt from the YAML on every invocation (YAML is the
  source of truth) — safe to re-run any time.

## Recording history

After running a tool, append the metric to the CSV and regenerate the
SVG with the tracking script:

```
uv run python docs/QA/scripts/qa_track.py                    # run all 5 tracked tools
uv run python docs/QA/scripts/qa_track.py mypy bandit        # subset
uv run python docs/QA/scripts/qa_track.py --charts-only      # only regen SVG from CSV
```

- Pure stdlib — no extra dependencies.
- One row per ISO date in `history/<tool>.csv`; re-running on the same
  day replaces that day's row.
- SVG is regenerated automatically after each append. To regenerate
  charts without re-running tools, use `--charts-only`.
- Multi-metric tools (bandit: high/medium/low, mypy: errors/files,
  radon-cc: avg/rank_c_plus, benchmark: score/warm_sc/cold_sc) produce
  one chart with multiple series.
- Same-day handling differs by tool:
  - **QA tools** (mypy, coverage, import-linter, bandit, radon-cc) —
    one row per ISO date; same-day re-runs replace that day's row.
  - **benchmark** — every run is kept (suffix `_1, _2, _3 …` when
    multiple share a date); CSV is rebuilt from
    `<base>/.homebase/benchmark.yaml` on each invocation.
- The CSVs are committed alongside the SVGs so trends survive across
  machines and sessions.

To track a new tool: add a `parse_<name>` function and an entry to
`TOOLS` in `scripts/qa_track.py`, then run it once to bootstrap the
CSV. Reference the new SVG inline in the relevant tool section above.

---

## Workflow

1. Run the tool(s) you intend to improve.
2. `uv run python docs/QA/scripts/qa_track.py [tool …]` — appends
   today's row, regenerates SVG.
3. Update the **Status snapshot** table with the new numbers.
4. Pick the next tool from **Iteration plan** below.
5. Commit only when ruff + pytest pass and the targeted-tool numbers
   improved or held.

### Single command for the full run

```
uv run pytest && \
uv run ruff check src/homebase/ tests/ && \
uv run mypy src/homebase && \
uv run pytest --cov=homebase --cov-report=term -q && \
uv run lint-imports && \
uv run vulture src/homebase && \
uv run bandit -q -r src/homebase && \
uv run radon cc src/homebase -a -s -n C && \
uv run python docs/QA/scripts/qa_track.py
```

`qa_track.py` with no args runs the 5 QA tools and also rebuilds the
benchmark CSV/SVG from the existing YAML — no new benchmark run is
triggered (use `uv b benchmark run` for that).

---

## Iteration plan

Tackled one tool at a time. Each entry: goal, expected scope, exit
criterion. Tick `[x]` when the snapshot number reaches the target.

### Phase 1 — layering (import-linter)

- [x] Eliminate inward-layer violations from `cache`, `metadata`,
      `config`, `workspace.seed` etc. (14 → 0).
- Exit: `uv run lint-imports` reports `0 broken`.

### Phase 2 — complexity hotspots (radon cc)

- [x] Split or simplify the rank-F / rank-E functions first:
      `filter.engine.compile_filter_expr` (E40 → B7),
      `filter.tag_index.sync_tag_symlinks_detailed` (E37 → B6),
      `commands.basic.cmd_ls` (F45 → C11).
- [ ] Bring all remaining rank-D+ entries to ≤ C, then average to ≤ B.
- Exit: avg ≤ B, no rank D+ functions.

### Phase 3 — typing (mypy)

- [ ] Fix the 233 errors module-by-module. Start with `cli/`,
      `commands/`, `core/`, then domain modules, then `ui/`.
- [ ] Add return-type annotations to all public functions in `core/`,
      `config/`, `metadata/`, `cache/`, `workspace/`.
- Exit: `uv run mypy` reports `Success`.

### Phase 4 — security (bandit)

- [ ] Triage the 4 High findings first (likely `subprocess` /
      `shell=True` / hardcoded paths). Fix or `# nosec` with reason.
- [ ] Drop Medium to 0.
- [ ] Review Low — most are likely `try/except/pass`. Tighten per
      AGENTS.md §8.
- Exit: 0 High, 0 Medium, < 20 Low.

### Phase 5 — coverage (pytest-cov)

- [ ] Raise branch coverage 51 % → 75 %. Prioritise modules with the
      lowest coverage that are also in the layering or complexity
      hotspots above.
- Exit: ≥ 75 % branch coverage.

### Phase 6 — dead code (vulture)

- [ ] Review the ~289 confidence-60 findings; delete confirmed unused
      code; suppress false positives with a one-line justification.
- Exit: confidence-60 output reviewed and resolved.

### Phase 7 — maintainability (radon mi)

- [ ] No file ranked below B. Likely overlaps with Phase 2 refactors.
- Exit: `uv run radon mi src/homebase -s -n B` is empty.

## Adding or removing a QA tool

- Add to `[dependency-groups] dev` in `pyproject.toml`.
- Add a `[tool.<tool>]` config block in `pyproject.toml`.
- Add a `### N. <tool>` section above with the `uv run` invocation.
- For tracked-over-time tools: add a `parse_<name>` + `TOOLS` entry in
  `scripts/qa_track.py`, run once to bootstrap, embed the SVG inline.
- Add a row to the **Status snapshot** table.
- Add a phase to the **Iteration plan** if a fix-up campaign is needed.
- Update AGENTS.md §10 if the tool is mandatory for commits.
